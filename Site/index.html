                How Jewish Refugees Escaped Poland
            </h3>
            <p1>
                After German forces had invaded Poland in 1939, thousands of Polish citizens, most of whom were Jewish, had fled the country in hopes of escaping the Nazis.
Many Polish Jews had headed east, though were met by Soviet forces, who alongside Nazi Germany, planned on seizing parts of Poland as their own.
Because of this, a lot of Poland’s Jewish population had been trapped in between the two nation’s attempts at conquering Poland, which eventually led to nearly 15,000 Polish Jewish refugees streaming into Lithuania, which was an independent nation at the time.
However, such safety did not last for long, as in June of 1940, several Soviet units had invaded Lithuania, and eventually had became a “satellite of Moscow.”
With opportunities to escape the Nazis becoming exponentially narrow, Jewish populations were put into a state of panic, especially due to how the Soviets had shut down all diplomatic operations within Lithuania.
Though, with the Netherlands ’ acting consul in Lithuaina Jan Zwartendijk and the help of Japan’s acting consul to Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara, many Jews seeking refuge in Lithuania were given entry visas for the Dutch island Curacao in the Caribean and Japanese transit visas to help them reach the island.

                How Jewish Refugees Escaped Germany
            </h3>
            <p1>
                During the period of time during and before World War 2, many people rescued Jewish refugees from their persecuters, the Nazis, in Germany. Their motives were all different, but at the same time they were very similar, these brave men and women saved the Jews in many ways from different situations. Some used their power to protect them and escort them out of Europe, while others used everything they had to pull off massive projects, such as the Kindertransport for Jewish children. Other powerful countries at the time did not want all of these refugees arriving in their long established, stable countries and possibly messing up their system of government. Some military used their rank to influence their country's decision, but these countries would not allow as many refugees as they could have, but these efforts still had great effects.

                What Influenced The Rescuers?
            </h3>
            <p1>
                One could argue that the decisions of the rescuers were influenced by numerous factors. An obvious example of these factors was the aversion held against the Nazis and their actions against Jews and other groups, which was held by many in Europe at the time. By taking in and hidden a Jewish family, you were effectively taking a stand against the Nazis. However, a more universal factor may have just been human sympathy and or friendship towards Jewish families who were targeted during the Holocaust.

                How Can Societies, Communities, and Individuals Reinforce and Strengthen the Willingness to Stand Up for Others?
            </h3>
            <p1>
                Societies, communities, and individuals can reinforce and strengthen the willingness to stand up for others by writing articles or books that describe what is happening and why people need to take action for the writer’s cause. When someone takes a stand, they are encouraging others to stand with them because others are afraid to stand alone, so when they know they won’t be alone if they take a stand, they are more likely to stand up for whomever/whatever the issue is affecting.

                What possible reasons can you think of that caused countries other than Germany – including the United States – to close or strictly limit their borders to Jewish refugees?
            </h3>
            <p1>
                Other countries closed their borders because they knew that some people had no one to take them in and these countries would eventually have a bunch of refugees that they would have to take care of and feed. Many of these governments were very powerful and they did not want to destabilize their government with a large amount of foreign people all arriving at once and debt from caring for these refugees.

            <h3>
                What reasons underlie today’s U.S. policy strictly limiting the number of refugees allowed to enter this country? Do you believe the U.S. should be more willing to welcome more people forced to flee their home countries due to push factors? Why/why not?

            </h3>
            <p1>
                Not restricting the number of refugees allowed to enter the country would lead to a possible economic and structural failure because the government would not have enough money and resources to take care of the refugees. Ethically speaking, The U.S should be more open to people who are fleeing their home countries in seek of refuge due to how it would be the most humane decision, fits in with what the nation stands for, and it would benefit the perception of the nation. However, accepting refugees, especially if they are unskilled workers, can be expensive as the U.S would have to provide for them, though the refugees wouldn’t bring benefits to the U.S in return.
